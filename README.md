fixHeartbleed
=============

Shell script I created to easily fix the Heartbleed vulnerability by installing openssl-1.0.1g.

Target
======

Red Hat 6.x and CentOS 6.x systems. It may work on 5.x for both RHEL and CentOS but has not been tested/validated.


Usage
======

Place this script on the server you wish to install openssl-1.0.1g on and execute.

./fixHeartbleed.sh

Contact
=======

Feel free to contact me regarding any questions, errors, issues, or enhancements. Better yet, feel free to fork this repo and enhance it and contribute. I don't know everything, as much as I may think I do.
